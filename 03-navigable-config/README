config package
--------------

Separate bean definitions by component and/or layer, e.g. one configuration 
for low level infrastructure like datasources, one for high level infrastructure 
components, one for repositories, one for services etc.

When connecting these separate configurations, use this pattern.

Two config files with responsibility for different components. 
MainService depends on one of the components from ServicesConfig. 
By importing the ServicesConfig, all Spring beans from the ServicesConfig are available, 
but instead of autowiring those components directly, wire the configuration class 
itself into the MainConfig and use it to reference beans from it.

Building configuration files this way, it’s easy to navigate through all 
dependencies by jumping directly into the method that defines the used component, 
even if the configuration class is in a jar on the classpath.
