config package
--------------

As per /01-spring-maven-abstract-dependency-defs, but now two implementations of the 
InfrastructureConfig interface are provided.  We can only autowire one into the 
AppConfig; only one may be active. 

With the @Profile annotation, configuration classes just get imported if the profile 
mentioned in the annotation is active.
