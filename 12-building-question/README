Can only work with the interface for the Builder, if using an aspect that intercepts
a method of the Builder.

Tried the aspect working with the interface = no change.

Fixed by casting and using interface in the main. Odd.

To make this work you need to add proxyTargetClass=true in 
aop config like @EnableAspectJAutoProxy(proxyTargetClass=true) for 
java based configuration or <aop:config proxy-target-class="true"></aop:config> 
for xml based configuration. This way spring aop will add the proxies forcefully.
